# Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
Sentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.

* Performed this analysis in Rstudio IDE
* Used a dataset provided by the R package ‘janeaustenR’.
* Utilized packages such as tidytext, tidyr, dplyr, reshape2, wordcloud,ggplot2.
* I created a wordcloud to delineate the most recurring positive and negative words. 
* Visualized by creating a plot showing sentiment score
